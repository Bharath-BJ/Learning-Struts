<!-- Localization - process of adapting our software application to particular region or locale
	 Internationalization - process to develop and designing the application to easy adaption to localization 
	 
     Here constant tag is mandatory to accept the internationalization and resource bundles were created for three different language as key value pairs 
     Usually the search order of resource bundles were
     1. Action.properties Eg: RegisterAction.properties
     2. package.properties
     3. global propertied (We are using the global properties for our application)
     
     Wherever required in validation.xml files, properties are provided as a key attribute
     in case of validate() method, using getText(key as a String) values are used
